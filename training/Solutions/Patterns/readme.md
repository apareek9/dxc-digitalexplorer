# Solution Patterns

## Standard Patterns

It's possible to create a single solution model as a Pattern within Digital Explorer; leveraging the full inimageation model and integrating the pattern into the wider inimageation eco-system the platimage enables.
A dedicated solution (sub)type for pattern is available today.

    <br>
1. **The Solution image**
    - The first page gives an overview of how to approach the solution submission.  The key here is to consider the piece parts within your solution.

1. Follow the standard solution entry walkthrough [LINK](../SubmittingSolutions/readme.md)



## Embedded Patterns

Digital Explorer also provides the ability to document 1 or more patterns within a single larger solution model (e.g. a Reference Architecture)

A new step is available within the solution submission process `Patterns`, within this section you have the option to create one or more embedded patterns within a given solution model.
